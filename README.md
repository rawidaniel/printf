# 0x11. C - printf

## Description

_printf replicates the C standard library printf() function.
What you should learn from this project:

* How to use git in a team setting
* Applying variadic functions to a big project
* The complexities of printf
* Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow

## Prototype
```int _printf(const char *format, ...);```
## Usage
* Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format
* All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c```
* Returns the number of characters in the output string on success, -1 otherwise
* Call it this way: ```_printf("format string", arguments...)``` where ```format string``` can contain conversion specifiers and flags,
along with regular characters
